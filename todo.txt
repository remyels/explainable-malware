- check the SHAPError's problem related to the addition of the shap values, for now we'll set check_additivity to false just to see if the results are ok
- may want to also write the different implementation of SHAP for neural net in the same spirit (batch gen)
- at the moment, there is a lot of redundant code. When you try to import a class definition from another file, there is an issue: when you import, all the code is run, unless you put a main at the end (I think?). Maybe isolate the common XGBC class
- parallelize the lime code just like we did for the shap code
- the malware for which we have the explanations seem to not be the same instances across different feature sets, so make sure to find a way to fix that
- add code to display bar plot (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bar-plot-in-matplotlib/) and check the implementation of the binary mlr and rfc
- look into why some experiments are breaking
- implement binary nn explanations using the same batching logic as that of the normalized implementation and check if it's properly running
